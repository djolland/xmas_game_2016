# Xmas Game - 2016
<p><b>A game made over christmas break of 2016 using the Slick2D Java game library.</b></p>
This was my first time creating a game in Java and the experience taught me a lot about game development. The idea for the game came about as a result of my real world interactions with Zelda the cat.

The goal of the game is to avoid the wandering cats while collecting as many presents as possible. Most of the time the cats will seek out and attack the christmas trees on the map, but if you hear the angry hiss sound that means a cat has spawned that will chase you down! The more presents you collect the more cats will spawn. But don't worry, if you collect enough presents your health bar will be refilled! Do you have what it takes to beat the highscore?!
